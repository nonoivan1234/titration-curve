## Problem
According to Example 15-9 Skoog Analysis Chemistry

Construct a curve for the titration of 25.00 mL of 0.1000 M maleic acid, HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with 0.1000 M NaOH

## Warning
Because the ratio of Ka1/Ka2 is so large (2 x 10^-4) that we can proceed the problem by using the techniques just described.
